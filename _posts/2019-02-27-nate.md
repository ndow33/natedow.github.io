Quick story about prospecting for gold and how it relates to prospecting for potential clients

Introduce the topic of sequences: what are sequences

Introduce the research question: Which sequences have the best reply rates? What are some characteristics of those sequences

Introduce the data: isolated to my sales team, 26 sequences, 15000+ emails sent, some sequences have calls others don't, etc.

PLOT INITIAL BAR GRAPH OF ALL SEQUENCES

![Initial Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndow33/ndow33.github.io/master/lambda_unit1_build/unfiltered%20reply%20rates.PNG){: .center-block :}

Acknowledge the bars that stand out and give context. Discuss how it's difficult to really tell the difference between all of them.

PLOT THE FILTERED BAR GRAPH

![Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndow33/ndow33.github.io/master/lambda_unit1_build/Reply%20Rates%20by%20Sequence.PNG){: .center-block :}

Discuss the filter: 100+ emails sent

Acknowledge that the graph would be more meaningful if we could compare the sequences to something else, like the average reply rate.
Discuss the average reply rate

PLOT THE REPLY RATES VERSE THE AVERAGE REPLY RATE ON A BAR GRAPH

Acknowledge that there are still a lot of bars. Filter out the bars that are less than the average reply rate.

PLOT THE REPLY RATES THAT ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE REPLY RATE ON A BAR GRAPH
