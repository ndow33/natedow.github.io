# A quick story about prospecting...

Picture this: you're a young carpenter living in California in 1848. You've moved to the rugged Sierra-Nevadas from New Mexico and are now working to build a water-powered sawmill for a Swiss fellow. One day as you're going about your work, you notice a sparkle in the river. Upon taking a closer look, you realize what you've found: GOLD!!! 

Following the discovery of gold, the famous California Gold-Rush of 1849 ensued. That year, California's non-native population went from less than 1000 to over 100,000 filling the state with prospectors who were hopeful that they too might strike gold. Although the frenzy of the gold-rush has come and gone, the pursuit of “gold” continues today in a different form.

Now, businesses prospect for people. For example, in sales, getting in front of the right person is paramount to success. Some of the qualities that the “right person” has include a problem your product can solve, authorization to buy, and budget. Much like gold, these people can be difficult to find. In fact, many companies have full-time employees whose entire job is to identify who these people are and reach out to them in an effort to get them to learn more. 

This process of finding and reaching out to the right people is actually called prospecting (you understand the analogy of the gold-rush now, don’t you).
